    "Coronavirus is a family of viruses that can cause illness, which can vary from common cold and cough to sometimes more severe disease. Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS-CoV) and Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS-CoV) were such severe cases with the world already has faced. SARS-CoV-2 (n-coronavirus) is the new virus of the coronavirus family, which first discovered in 2019, which has not been identified in humans before. It is a contiguous virus which started from Wuhan in December 2019. Which later declared as Pandemic by WHO due to high rate spreads throughout the world. Currently (on the date 20 May 2020), this leads to a total of 300K+ Deaths across the globe, including 90K+ deaths alone in USA.The dataset  is provided to identify the deaths and recovered cases.\n",
